# StudyStacks

### Flashcard software to help you study more effectively.

StudyStacks is an application that serves to help students and learners create and manage flashcards they can use daily 
to reinforce their learning. Users can create ***stacks*** of their own cards with information on both sides, customized to 
their liking. They are able ***study*** their cards in sequential or random order. Being a university student myself,
I found that creating an application to help myself and other students learn more effectively would be interesting as I
am able to understand the problem domain particularly well. Students are always on the hunt for tools to help them study
more efficiently and StudyStacks aims to be just that.

StudyStacks may be helpful if you find yourself in any of these situations: 
- You are a university student studying for midterms or finals.
- You find yourself in a foreign country and need to learn the language.
- You are meeting your girlfriend's parents soon and need to memorize facts about her dad's favourite football team.
